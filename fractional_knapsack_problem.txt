fractionalKnapsack:
    for i=1 to nth object
        calculate profit/weight i.e p/w

    sort objects in drcreasing order of p/w ratio
    objectFraction[n];

    for i=1 to n
        objectFraction[i] = 0

    for i=1 to n
        if M>0 and wi<=M //where M=knapsack capacity and wi=weight of ith object
            M = M - wi
            P = P + pi // where P=total profit and pi=profit from ith object
            objectFraction[i] = 1
        else
            break
    
    if M>0
        P = P + pi*(M/wi)
        objectFraction[i] = M/wi

    Print weights and fraction of the object taken
